title: Reuse before Buy before Build
statement: |
  Re-use and integrate existing applications and solutions defined as target architecture before investing in new solutions. Use Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) before building software.
rationale: |
  Our goal is to reduce project cost & duration. Bespoke development tends to be more expensive and developer availability is a bottleneck.
implications: |
  - Before development, assess potential for reuse of generic building blocks and content from other applications.
