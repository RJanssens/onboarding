title: Continuous architecture
statement: |
 Architecture is an ongoing activity. Systems should keep evolving after initial delivery to support organizational change and technological disruption.
rationale: |
  Dead, rigid IT systems bring the organization to a standstill and are unable to support business disruption.
implications: |
  Treat systems as products rather than projects. Architecture activities stop when the product is decommissioned, not with production go-live.
