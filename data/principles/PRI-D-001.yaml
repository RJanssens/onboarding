title: Single source of truth
statement: |
  Information should have a single source of truth (“authentic source”). This is a platform that is accessed by all other information systems needing access to that data. 
rationale: |
  - When data is centralized in a single source of truth, consumers are confident they are using the definitive, up-to-date version of the data. <br/>
  - By using a single source of truth, we avoid duplicate data entries & versioning issues.
implications: |
  - Note that this principle does not state: “all data must be store in <b>one centralized</b> platform serving as single source of truth (SSOT)” but rather “all data needs to be attributable to a source location acting as SSOT.”<br/>
  - Systems are allowed to replicate information in local caches for performance reasons, but they should be aware of the risks and avoid sharing cached data outside their borders.
