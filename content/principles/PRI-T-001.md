title: Control Technical Diversity
statement: |
  Technological diversity is controlled to minimize the non-trivial cost of maintaining expertise in and connectivity between multiple processing environments.
rationale: |
  There is a real, non-trivial cost of infrastructure required to support alternative technologies for processing environments. There are further infrastructure costs incurred to keep multiple processor constructs interconnected and maintained.<br/>

  Limiting the number of supported components will simplify maintainability and reduce costs.<br/>

  This principle does not preclude innovation. Technology advances and the organizationâ€™s technology stacks should evolve accordingly. We must however carefully weigh the benefits of adopting new technology against their costs.
implications: |
  - Before embracing a new technology, analyze the long-term development and operational impact.<br/>
  - Migration of legacy systems to the new technology is necessary to reduce technological sprawl.
