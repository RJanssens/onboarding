# What are principles?
Principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission.

In their turn, principles may be just one element in a structured set of ideas that collectively define and guide the organization, from values through to actions and results.

Depending on the organization, principles may be established within different domains and at different levels. 

## Categories

{{< figure src="/img/content/principles/scope.png" alt="Principle categories" width="100%" >}}

Principles are divided in the following categories:

- [Business principles](/principles/business)
- [Data principles](/principles/data)
- [Application principles](/principles/application)
- [Technology Infrastructure principles](/principles/infrastructure)

## Qualities of Principles
Merely having a written statement that is called a principle does not mean that the principle is good, even if everyone agrees with it.

A good set of principles will be founded in the beliefs and values of the organization and expressed in language that the business understands and uses. Principles should be few in number, future-oriented, and endorsed and championed by senior management. They provide a firm foundation for making architecture and planning decisions, framing policies, procedures, and standards, and supporting resolution of contradictory situations. A poor set of principles will quickly become disused, and the resultant architectures, policies, and standards will appear arbitrary or self-serving, and thus lack credibility. Essentially, principles drive behavior.

There are five criteria that distinguish a good set of principles:

- **Understandable**: the underlying tenets can be quickly grasped and understood by individuals throughout the organization

The intention of the principle is clear and unambiguous, so that violations, whether intentional or not, are minimized.

- **Robust**: enable good quality decisions about architectures and plans to be made, and enforceable policies and standards to be created

Each principle should be sufficiently definitive and precise to support consistent decision-making in complex, potentially controversial situations.

- **Complete**: every potentially important principle governing the management of information and technology for the organization is defined - the principles cover every situation perceived

- **Consistent**: strict adherence to one principle may require a loose interpretation of another principle

The set of principles must be expressed in a way that allows a balance of interpretations. Principles should not be contradictory to the point where adhering to one principle would violate the spirit of another. Every word in a principle statement should be carefully chosen to allow consistent yet flexible interpretation.

- **Stable**: principles should be enduring, yet able to accommodate changes

An amendment process should be established for adding, removing, or altering principles after they are ratified initially.
