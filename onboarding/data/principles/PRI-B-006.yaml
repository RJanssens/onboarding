title: Keep it short & simple (KISS)
statement: |
  Focus on a simple solution that meets the requirements.
rationale: |
  Simplicity is a highly desirable quality in software applications. Making software more complicated than it needs to be lowers the overall quality of software.<br/>
  The maintainability, testability, and supporting the business disruption are reduced when complexity increases.
implications: |
  - Avoid the “Rolls Royce” solution when you need a low-end car.<br/>
  - Design the problem as easy to develop and easy to throw away; sometimes throwing away and re-creating is simpler and cheaper than maintaining it.<br/>
  - Avoid abstraction and dependencies.<br/>
  - Don’t oversimplify a design. Stop breaking things down when you reach a point that negatively affects the design of the application.
